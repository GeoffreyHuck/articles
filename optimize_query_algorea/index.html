<p>You know those crazy SQL queries. I recently optimized one of them for the project <a href="https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorea</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A service of the API was very slow and I&#8217;ve been asked if I can fix it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll describe here the process I took to do that. Along with the mindset I use when I&#8217;m facing such challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe that the mindset is the most important part.
It&#8217;s the secret that makes you better and motivated on the long run.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_replicate_the_slow_execution_time">Replicate the slow execution time</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you need to replicate. Don&#8217;t work without seeing the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might mean loading a lot of data in your database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not proceed to the next step until you see the slow execution time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_find_the_culprit">Find the culprit</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you see the slow execution time, you need to find the cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, the cause is a slow SQL query. But in real life, it could also come from the code, the network, or anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to have a way to time-debug your code. Avoid hacking your way in to do that.
An easy way to debug the execution time will save you a lot of time in the long run.
If you don&#8217;t have it, invest now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, we have all queries along with their execution time logged in a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what I found:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    [2023-12-12 09:23:47]  [2467.47ms] **complex query here**</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The complex query is the one I need to optimize. It takes 2.5 seconds to execute.
The whole service takes about the same time to execute, so this is the culprit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I do is to copy-paste the query in a SQL editor, and run it to make sure it&#8217;s as slow as in the logs.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock center">
<div class="content">
<img src="optimize_query_algorea/slow_query_heidisql.PNG" alt="Slow SQL query HeidiSQL">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use HeidiSQL, but you can use any SQL editor you like. As can see at the bottom of the screenshot, the query takes 5 seconds to execute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We found the culprit!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_look_at_the_issue_the_eyes">Look at the issue the eyes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have the query, we need to understand it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like to say that a formatted code is already half understood. So, let&#8217;s format it.</p>
</div>

<p>How long it&#8217;ll take doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;ll take as long as it takes. You can&#8217;t go faster than the process.</p>

<li>
<p>If I feel stress in my body, or any kind of urgency, I stop and take the time to relax first.</p>

<li>
<p>The only way to get better is to do scary things. So I&#8217;m grateful for the opportunity to learn something new.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to jump right into the problem, without understanding it first.</p>

<p>You might think it saves time, but it&#8217;s actually the opposite.</p>
</div>

<p>In this case, it&#8217;s part of a history API. It&#8217;s used to display the history of group of users.</p>

<h3 id="_understand_the_query">Understand the query</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before digging into the details, I like to understand the general structure of the query.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a first glance, we can see that:
- there are 3 CTEs (items_to_show, participants, start_from_row)
- there is a big UNION ALL with 3 SELECT</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The context helps us to understand that the 3 SELECT that are union together are used to fetch the different types of activities in one query.</p>

<p>Of course, we can ask ourselves if this is the best way to do it. But that&#8217;s not the point here.</p>

<p>By narrowing down even further, we find that the problem is coming from the ORDER BY clause.
This is exactly what we saw in the EXPLAIN result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s some interesting questions to ask yourself at this point:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do we really need to sort the results? In this case, we want to see the most recent activities first. So yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why&#8217;s the ORDER BY so complex? Can we simplify it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that we cannot create an index with the CASE&#8230;&#8203;WHEN&#8230;&#8203;END statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, it can be removed because it&#8217;s not actually used.
It is merely used as a tie breaker, for the results to be deterministic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can continue to sort by answers.type to keep the tie-breaker, but the actual order doesn&#8217;t matter.
It seems that the statement was either copied or is coming from a previous version of the query.</p>

<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve seen that in order to optimize a complex SQL query, we need to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Replicate the slow execution time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the query causing the issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get your mindset right!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the context and the issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Narrow down the origin of the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the issue and test it works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure there are no other issues</p>
