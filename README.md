# Articles

## Overview

This repository contains the articles that can be seen or will be seen live on my blog : [geoffreyhuck.com](geoffreyhuck.com).

The format used is AsciiDoc, in a way that can be integrated into the blog system that I released [here](https://github.com/GeoffreyHuck/blog).

I hope my repository will enable you to easily produce scientific content with formulae, plots and schematics.
